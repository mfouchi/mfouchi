### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page.  I've been using GitHub off and on since 2012, but only with a private repo (QMSTools).  I don't own the project, so I cannot make it public.  I only recently started working on a personal public project in 2020.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the 'ShowTkt' project as a way for me to learn new technologies and eventually use in production.
